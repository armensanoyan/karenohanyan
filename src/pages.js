    <div  className='biography_block' >
      <p>Armenian post-soviet art has already passed the period that can be divided into the three stages: anti-soviet, postmodern and social-political.</p><br/>
      <p>The last one is characterized by the return to active participation in social, economical, cultural and political clashes, when artists having critical approach toward the established art systems are trying to work outside of its institutions.</p><br/>
      <p>Karen Ohanyan plays a pivotal role in the movements associated with this third stage. Participation, transgressive actions (for which he’d got “Shiz” nickname), political fidelity and - as he defines - “the aesthetics of frontal and factual realism” - are the principles of his art.</p><br/>
      <p>Karen Ohanyan's involvement into political currents began in 2003, when he stood at the forefront of the riot among the protesters who clashed with police.</p><br/>
      <p>In the tragic events of March 1, 2008 the corrupted authorities dispersed the peaceful rally and 10 people were killed by government forces. Since that Karen Ohanyan actively participates in any form of social resistance promoting a political agenda of anarchism.</p><br/>
      <p>Karen Ohanyan is a fine art painter and actionist. His actionist experience is transformed into his paintings and at the same time it reflects his critical approach to the realism in Fine Art. Karen Ohanyan’s paintings challenge conventions by depicting reality.</p><br/>
      <p>Since 2007 Karen Ohanyan is a founder member of “Art Lab” - the political art group. The group’s activities and projects are aimed to create and distribute the collective forms of art, self-organization and development of the new communities.</p><br/>
      <p>As the most influential ideas and sometimes the source of inspiration Karen Ohanyan often mentions the name of Gustave Courbet - french social realist painter imprisoned for his involvement with the Paris Commune. This may explain why the media of fine art for Karen is more important in his struggle against the capitalist mass culture. Fine art is traditional, however it has a great potential for being politicized because it is immune to many mechanisms and methods widely used to control digital media.</p><br/>
      <p>Political Fine art is capable to visualize the uncontrolled and transgressive, the fact, which often remains unseen. Karen Ohanyan explores this distinctive feature of Fine art in his masterly painted canvases.</p><br/>

      <h1 className='article_title'>Real Utopias </h1>
      <h3 className='article_sup_title'>Vardan Azatyan / 2006</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>If taking into account artistic and technical characteristics, as well as the scale and ambition of Karen Ohanyan’s series Real Utopias (2005-2006), one can claim that they are among the best paintings recently produced in Armenia. This article attempts at a formal- structural and social analysis of this series.</p>
      <h1 className='article_title'>Karen Ohanyan’s “Real Utopias”</h1>
      <h3 className='article_sup_title'>Gohar Vardanyan / 2006</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>From May 5-31, 2006, Karen Ohanyan’s “Real Utopias” exhibition was heldin one of the contemporary art museums called ACCEA (Armenian Center for Contemporary Experimental Art). In the accompanying textof the exhibition the curator and art critic Vardan Azatyan presented the author using the formal-structural and social analysis of his works.</p>
      <h1 className='article_title'>Walls</h1>
      <h3 className='article_sup_title'>Eva Khachatryan / 2007</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>The gloomy wall, erected by Karen Ohanyan, arouses several associations. First with symbolism of barrier, obstacle and walls famous in the history of mankind, which have caused revolutions and wars. After this in Ohanyan’s works the wall turns into part of a larger attention to every stone and its specific significance.</p>
      <h1 className='article_title'>Body Investments</h1>
      <h3 className='article_sup_title'>Vardan Jaloyan / 2008</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>Karen Ohanyan’s “Real Utopias” series, created a few years ago, was ranked among the best paintings of the year. [2] I think Ohanyan’s latest series of paintings, “Body Investment”. Also deserves such high praise. It’ s not difficult to find commonalities between these two projects, even if the first is more existential and the second, more political. In “Real Utopias”, the body is viewed as a last “real thing” and as a utopia – the last free creative space. In “Body Investments”, the body is viewed differently; it is an actual space, a battlefield of micropowers.</p>
      <h1 className='article_title'>From Avant-garde to Avant-garde</h1>
      <h3 className='article_sup_title'>Elena Aydinyan / 2016</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>During the 1920’s, the Soviet people were engaged in building a utopia. That utopia seemed to be absolutely feasible. Russian avant-garde was one of the ways to construct a new World. The subsequent periods of Soviet history indicate the failure of the realization of the utopia assumed by the 1920’s. One after another they alienated and washed away its contour.</p>
